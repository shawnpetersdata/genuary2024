            <h1> Genuary 29 - Shooting Stars</h1>
            <p>The mathematics behind signed distance functions (SDFs) intrigues me, but trying to implement them in p5.js last year left me unimpressed by their speed.</p>
            <p>Since shaders seem optimized for the repetitive pixel by pixel calculations that SDFs are built on I decided to try that route. I've fairly beginner level when it comes to shaders, but I'm glad to say that I managed to implement many stars being animated being drawn solely based on SDF calculations.</p>
