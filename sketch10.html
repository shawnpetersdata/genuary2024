            <h1> Genuary 10 - Hexagonal Tiling</h1>
            <p>A variation of drawing a random diagonal on a square grid.</p>
            <p>A hexagonal grid is constructed with a random line joining two of the vertices. The result is a little more segmented but there does seem to be some order in the chaos.</p>
            <p>If I've learned nothing else, it's that I really don't like working with hexagons.</p>
