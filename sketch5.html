            <h1> Genuary 5 - In The Style of Vera Molnár</h1>
            <p>I'm really drawn to Molnár's work with squares, so I undertook to create something similar.</p>
            <p>Here I used a lot of noise to create square tiles with a fair amount of variation. Seeding each tile allowed for some small variations to occur over time.</p>
            <p>Colors were chosen to represent ink as thought the composition was created by hand or by plotter. </p>
