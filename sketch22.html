            <h1> Genuary 22 - Attractions </h1>
            <p>The prompt Point - line - plane lead me to revisit Kandinsky's work. I tried to use his thought on these elements to influence the creation of this piece.</p>
            <p>Using toxiclibs.js, I made static circular attractors, straight lines pinned on one end only, and static planes that were created to fill some of the spaces between.</p>
            <p>After running the physics engine for a number of cycles, I used p5.brush to add a watercolour effect to the resultant scene. I love the overall effect, but I need to look deeper in the library before using it again.</p>
