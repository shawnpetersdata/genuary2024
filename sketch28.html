            <h1> Genuary 28 - Found Haiku</h1>
            <p>Skeuomorphism refers to qualities of objects that are derived from earlier versions yet serve no purpose in modern versions. In this piece I included a typerwriter style font on a paper texture with typewriting animation and flickering candlelight; none of which are necessary for a generative poetry project.</p>
            <p>To fit the overall scene, I used rita.js and regular expressions to search through <i>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</i> by Arthur Conan Doyle for naturally occurring haikus. There is some issue when the text contains numbers and abbreviations, but the result is typically in the correct format.</p>
