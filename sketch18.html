            <h1> Genuary 18 - Bauhaus Circles</h1>
            <p>I focused on the minimalistic and geometric themes that seem to be a major piece of Bauhaus artwork.</p>
            <p>I used a lot of randomness to add in some variation which I think really brings something special to some of the generated pieces.</p>
            <p>As I was putting this together all of the circles and semi-circles reminded me of the CBC logo, so instead of using primary colours, I took inspiration from their 1970s - 1980s logo.</p>
