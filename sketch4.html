            <h1> Genuary 4 - Pixels</h1>
            <p>I really wanted to avoid pixel art with this prompt, so I looked at how LCD TVs display images and interpreted that as pixels.</p>
            <p>Artworks were scaled down to 64x64 and displayed based on the brightness of red, green, and blue values.</p>
            <p>The images were coming out a little dark, so I layered in a little backlight based on the intensity of the colors. As far as I know, this is a problem for many TV types, but a solution here.</p>
