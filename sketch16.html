            <h1> Genuary 16 - Splitting Triangles</h1>
            <p>It would turn out that 10000 is a larger number than I conceptualized. I took many different approaches which became too sluggish to render. I will be reusing some of these "failed" attempts as later Genuary projects as they could fit in later.</p>
            <p>Here I used a light source object to split triangles into additional triangles made from their red, green, and blue values. I tried to mimic shadows to an extent, but the chaos of 10000 objects makes it a little hard to pick out the overall effect.</p>
