            <h1> Genuary 19 - Intrusive Thoughts</h1>
            <p>I took some time to work through Daniel Shiffman's flocking simulation and upgraded it to 3d.</p>
            <p>Instead of having the objects wrap around the screen, I an attractive force in the center that increased with the distance away so that they would eventually come back.</p>
            <p>Initially I had intended to have them orbit a sphere in the centre of the screen, but they kept intersecting it. Instead of fixing it, I made the bug a feature,found a 3d model of a brain on Turbo Squid, and "Intrusive Thoughts" was born.</p>
