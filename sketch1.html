            <h1> Genuary 1 - Particles (Lots of them)</h1>
            <p>I wanted to create something interactive for this sketch so I came up with particles being influenced by movement.</p>
            <p>To keep the framerate reasonable, I limited the total amount of particles and used a circle packing algorithm to arrange them.</p>
            <p>When movement is detected, the particles move, and when there is no motion, they try to restore the original position.</p>
            <p>The particles update their color based on the webcam information of where they are meant to be located.</p>
