            <h1> Genuary 26 - Embroidered Plants</h1>
            <p>Barney Codes really carried me on this one. His tutorials on generative l-systems formed the basis of plants and their growth.</p>
            <p>I modified his code to a more class based approach and used it to add various patterns and more plants at random positions.</p>
            <p>Initially, I had intended to thicken the plants as they grew, but the colors and thinness reminded me of an embroidered plant pattern that I'm sure I've seen 100 times before but can't quite put my finger on it. I grabbed a textile pattern from Unsplash and here we are. </p>
