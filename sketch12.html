            <h1> Genuary 12 - Ooze</h1>
            <p>Experimenting with metaballs while trying to keep the framerate up and the resolution reasonable.</p>
            <p>It took a bit but the end result seems to be a nice balance between quality and speed.</p>
            <p>I also added in some temporary static negative metaballs to see how that would affect things. After clamping to avoid negative totals, I think they helped with the overall effect.</p>
