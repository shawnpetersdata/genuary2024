            <h1> Genuary 24 - Irregular Penrose Triangles </h1>
            <p>I found that <a href = "https://editor.p5js.org/ri1/sketches/-rnL0CGF">someone</a> had sketched out a penrose triangle using vertices, so I repurposed it to make my own. I used HSL values to keep the colouring the same while applying darkness and lightness to give the required appearance.</p>
            <p>Once I was happy with the overall look, I tiled it on an irregular rectangular grid and varied the colouring based on noise. Simple looking piece, but it actually took me longer than some of the more complex ones.</p>
