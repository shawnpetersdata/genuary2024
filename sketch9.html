            <h1> Genuary 9 - ASCII Me No Questions</h1>
            <p>This one takes a bit to load, so be patient.</p>
            <p>The source item, by Kristina Flour via Unsplash, is sized down, blurred, and run through edge detection. Circles are then packed in through a growth packing algorithm, avoiding each other and the edges.</p>
            <p>Once the image is segmented, characters are chosen based on the brightness of the sections. Colours are chosen based on the RGB values of the area. Font size is determined by the radius of the packed circles and then everything gets thrown out the window by randomness.</p>
            <p>This would work for other images if the source code was changed to reference the new file.</p>
