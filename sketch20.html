            <h1> Genuary 20 - Evolving Typography</h1>
            <p>Not knowing quite what generative typography would be, I watched an interesting talk by Lynne Yun. I decided try to merge the computer's understanding of a letter as a pointer based on its ascii / unicode value and my visual understanding of letters.</p>
            <p>Using a genetic algorithm, the program tries to approximate the shape of the letter using only the character code for the letter. To make it more visually interesting, I layered the attempts.</p>
            <p>This is fairly slow since there are many generations to process. I also had trouble with the flattened pixel array. No idea why it didn't work in this case, but I had to grab the pixels one by one, slowing it down further.</p>
