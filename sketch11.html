            <h1> Genuary 11 - Generative Quilt</h1>
            <p>I was inspired by Anni Albers work with textiles and decided to represent the work in quilt form.</p>
            <p>Using toxiclibs I was able to apply the generated texture to a cloth-like mesh and added a little simulated wind to bring it to life.</p>
