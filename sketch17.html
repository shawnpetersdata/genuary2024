            <h1> Genuary 17 - Islamic Tiling</h1>
            <p>A neat effect, but not exactly what I was going for. This is definitely worth revisiting in the future.</p>
            <p>I set up construction points based on a 4 fold setup and randomly chose which points would be connected. Since I am terrible at geometry, I limited my algorithm to create square patterns that I could easily tesselate.</p>
            <p>I don't think I fully captured the complexity of Islamic geometric patterns, but it was definitely a learning experience.</p>
